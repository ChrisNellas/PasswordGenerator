# PasswordGenerator
create 2 type of passwords, an entirely random password and a semi-random password using user's inputs. What type of password will be produced is defined by user's choice.
If the user select the semi-random password then he/she asked to submit his/her firstname, lastname and year of birth.
The program uses the first 2 chars of firstname, lastname and the last 2 digits of user's birth year.
The position of each personal information in the created password is randomly selected.
The minimum password length is 8 characters in order to have 2 chars/input in a random position.
